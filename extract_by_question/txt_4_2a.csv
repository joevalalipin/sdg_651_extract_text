"8","4.2a","Status description: In Australia, states and territories are primarily responsible for managing water resources in their jurisdiction, including making decision and building, operating and maintaining water infrastructure (e.g. dams, water supply and sewerage treatment systems). For example, The New South Wales (NSW) Government recently announced a $1 billion Safe and Secure Program. This program will target water and sewerage projects in regional NSW to ensure infrastructure meets contemporary standards for water security, public health, environmental and safety outcomes into the future. It will provide co-funding to successful applicants such as local councils, water utilities, water corporations and prescribed dam owners for detailed planning and construction activities to install, augment or decommission water and sewerage infrastructure.Australia’s first full-scale Groundwater Replenishment Scheme is located in Western Australia and recharges recycled water in Perth’s aquifers. In 2016, the Western Australia Government committed $262 million to expand the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment plant used to recharge the aquifer system. Queensland Government’s SEQ Water Grid is valued at around $9 billion and allows the movement of treated drinking water around the region. It consists of dams, treatment plants, a desalination plant, water reservoirs, supply pipelines and pump stations.  Victoria also has a Water Grid which consists of dams, reservoirs, weirs and the Victorian Desalination Project. In 2018, the Victorian Government established the Water Grid Partnership. The partnership builds on government investment including the $80.6 million South West Loddon Pipeline, $85.2 million East Grampians Pipeline and $43 million Lance Creek Water Connection.In 2018, the Tasmanian Government committed $400 million into stormwater and sewerage infrastructure in Launceston.  Over a number of years in South Australia, a number of significant partnership programs between the Australian and South Australian Governments have been implemented or are underway, particularly focussed on measures to improve and support agricultural productivity, the long term resilience of wetlands and floodplains and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental water use - with a particular focus on the Murray Darling Basin.Decision making around the operation and use of infrastructure, particularly large environmental water infrastructure, requires investment in various forms of monitoring. State recurrent investment is often required for ongoing operations, maintenance and monitoring of infrastructure constructed under joint State and Australian Government programs to manage the asset portfolio, to cover resourcing, asset condition and maintenance strategies, and asset renewal.The Australian Government has also been co-investing with state governments, through the NWIDF,  to accelerate the construction of major water infrastructure projects such as dams, weirs, pipelines, managed aquifer recharge, and waste water treatment and reuse schemes to provide affordable and secure water supplies to support the growth of regional economies and communities across Australia.","Way forward: ","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"
