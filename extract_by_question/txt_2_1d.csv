"3","2.1d","État d’avancement : Afin d’améliorer la qualité et l’efficacité des services publics de l’eau et de l’assainissement, les pouvoirs publics ont pris, en 2006, la décision de confier au secteur privé la gestion de l’eau et de l’assainissement dans les principales grandes wilayas du pays, dont Alger. Il a ainsi été procédé à la conclusion de contrats entre des entreprises privées étrangères et des sociétés publiques, filiales commune de l’algérienne des eaux et de l’office national d’assainissement, concessionnaire des services de distribution d’eau et d’assainissement en Algérie pour la gestion des eaux et de l’assainissement d’Alger, d’Oran, et de Constantine.Les réformes adoptées par les pouvoirs publics ont conduit à un nouveau système de gestion impliquant le secteur privé. Cette démarche progressive est accompagnée et consolidée par une amélioration des moyens et des capacités des sociétés de gestion locale, garantie d’efficacité et de durabilité.","Perspectives pour l’avenir : La loi relative à l’eau, en cours de révision, prévoit une large ouverture vers le secteur privé.","Algeria_651_2020_FR_Final_21.10.2020.docx"

"8","2.1d","Status description: Community and private sector engagement is an essential part of processes for state water resource management planning, as outlined in national guidelines. It is usual practice for Australian government agencies to consult with the private sector.Australia regularly engages with private sector stakeholders through peak bodies that are involved and regularly engaged on water resource policy, management and programs. Examples of these peak bodies include the Australian Water Association, Water Services Association of Australia, National Irrigators’ Council, National Farmers Federations, Australian Conservation Foundation, Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations and the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations etc. Stakeholders are also engaged individually through private and public meetings.Infrastructure programs regularly seek feedback from industry bodies to improve implementation of funding rounds or in the development of new programs.The Water Efficiency Program also uses Delivery Partners, which may be a part of a State Government, to develop, manage and implement projects with industry and individuals. The ACCC inquiry into the operation of water markets in the Basin has included meetings with businesses and the community as well as a call for submissions for publication during the inquiry. The interim inquiry reports will also be available for community consideration. The ACCC commenced the inquiry in August 2019 and will finish it in November 2020, allowing sufficient time for business consideration. BoM also undertook a review of the water information function and engaged with the regulated community, including industry and government. In 2017, the Northern Basin Taskforce held discussions with various business organisations as part of its consultation process. In particular, feedback was sought on recommendations from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s Northern Basin Review. There were also many local organisations and groups that participated including Environment Victoria, Namoi Water, Border Rivers Food & Fibre etc.The Western Australian Government released the Waterwise Perth Action Plan which sets out the direction for transitioning Perth to a waterwise city by 2030.  The plan includes numerous actions to be implemented by state agencies, industry, business and the community to deliver water use efficiencies and the development of alternative water supplies to ensure Perth’s lifestyle and business opportunities are maintained in a changing climate.The South Australian Government is actively working with the local water sector to support new market and investment opportunities within the State and internationally.  The Government provides a brokerage service to connect the water industry with local and global partners to enable:The supply of products and services;Inward business investment;Research and development collaboration;Education and training.","Way forward: Australian government agencies will continue to consult with the private sector to ensure water resource management policies are developed with consideration of perspectives.  Under the Water Act, the PC is required to undertake three-yearly inquiries into the progress of reform in Australia’s water resources sector.  As part of this inquiry, an issues paper was released on 26 May 2020 to guide people in preparing a submission. It outlines a range of issues on which the Commission is seeking information and feedback. Participants are asked to provide evidence to support their views, including data and specific examples where possible.As an example, the Australian Government will shortly commence consultation with peak bodies, including the National Irrigators’ Council and First Nations groups, on the proposed amendments to the Water Act that will strengthen the compliance and enforcement powers of the MDBA. This will provide peak bodies with an opportunity to shape the legislation prior to its introduction to Parliament. South Australia is continuing to develop a dedicated water industry development plan to support the further growth of this sector and to build private capacity as a foundation to continuously adapt to water related climate change impacts on the environment, economy and society.  This strategy will identify and enable programs to leverage all industry development avenues, including delivering products and services that align with the Governments overarching water management policy agenda.
