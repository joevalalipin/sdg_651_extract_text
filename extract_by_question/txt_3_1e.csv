"8","3.1e","Status description: In order to strengthen Australia’s national resilience, on 13 March 2020 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG):  endorsed the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework to guide national action to address existing disaster risks and minimise new risks;signed the National Partnership Agreement for Disaster Risk Reduction and agreed to invest $261 million over five years for risk reduction initiatives; andasked Emergency Management Ministers to expedite a National Action Plan to implement the Framework, in consultation with other COAG councils and forums. In addition, the Government:has established a Critical Incident Planning capability to:bolster our ability to prepare and effectively respond to critical incidents that have widespread impacts across our communities, and better understand, and build resilience within, critical systems that provide essential services to Australians and first respondershas established the Emergency Response Fund to provide a sustainable way to funding disaster risk reduction effort;is providing funding for the development of national telecommunications capabilities;providing funding for the Household Resilience Program, which provides assistance to eligible home owners in coastal parts of Queensland to make practical improvements to reduce the impacts of cyclones;has published resources to help key decision makers across all sectors to take action to reduce disaster risk;is helping communities recover from disasters by investing in resilience through the joint Commonwealth-State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA), including:allowing states and territories to use the savings they generate from rebuilding essential public assets under the DRFA towards mitigation projects; and providing flexibility for states and territories to restore damaged assets to a more resilient standard.Water management plans such as the Basin Plan and state water resource plans are implemented so that the impacts of very dry conditions (such as Australia’s millennium drought) are minimised. In some areas, this covers critical human water needs. Extreme dry events trigger special management and operational responses to conserve remaining water supplies and limit the impacts that are otherwise unavoidable. ","Way forward: The Department of Home Affairs is responsible for the ongoing implementation of the above activities through Emergency Management Australia. The Department of Home Affairs is also establishing a new national capability to ensure people have access to the best information and guidance needed to make risk-informed decisions so we can continue to be resilient in the future.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

"19","3.1e","Status description: Bhutan is highly prone to hydro-meteorological hazards due to young fragile mountain geology and high intensity recurrence monsoon. Being a mountainous country more than 70% settlements and infrastructure development are established along the river valley. In order to reduce impacts of water-related disasters, through the donor supported projects flood/GLOF hazards mapping were done for Mangdechhu, Chamkharchhu valley, Punatsangchhu basin and other settlement areas. GLOF/Flood early warning system were installed and operational on Punakha-Wangdi valley, Mangdechhu basin, Chamkharchhu basin. Lowering of potentially dangerous lakes were carried out in the Luanan area to reduce the risk through short term projects. Vulnerability mapping and assessment are being initiated.  Community Based Disasters Risks Management (CBDRM) education and awareness activities were carried out in all the Dzongkhags and schools including the contingency planning.More importantly Bhutan has legal instrument- Disaster Management Act of Bhutan (2013) and Disaster Management Rules and Regulations (2014) that provide the legal framework for the disaster risks reduction in Bhutan. In Bhutan, disasters is mainstreamed into development plans and programs.","Way forward: ","Bhutan_651_2020_EN_Final_05.01.2021.docx"
