"8","3.2a","Status description: Water management plans are widely applied in Australia. The Basin Plan is a legislative instrument that supports detailed water resource plans for the river system.Water trading is also well established in Australia with the most developed water market located in the southern part of the Basin. This market has been developing and maturing since the 1980s. Separate markets exist for water entitlements (long-term shares in available water supply) and water allocations (volumes of water for use in the current year). They play a vital role for the irrigation sector and allows the efficient reallocation of water between farming businesses in response to changes in supply and demand. The Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement, signed by the Australian, Queensland, South Australian and Northern Territory Governments, provides for the sustainable management of the water and related natural resources associated with cross-border river systems in the Lake Eyre Basin to avoid downstream impacts on associated environmental, economic and social values.  ","Way forward:The second Review of the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was completed in June 2018. A Ministerial Forum response to the Review’s recommendations is currently being developed.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is undertaking a review of the Basin water market. This review, once finalised in 2020, may recommend actions for improving aspects of the market.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

Austria is a landlocked country. All national parts of the three international river basin districts Danube (AT1000), Rhine (AT2000) and Elbe (AT5000), and therefore the entire Austrian territory, are covered by the Austrian RBMP. The National RBMP and the National FRMP are in line and coordinated with the international RBMPs and FRMPs for the Danube, the Rhine and the Elbe.For Danube RBMP see ICPDR Homepage: https://www.icpdr.org/main/activities-projects/river-basin-management-plan-update-2015For Danube FRMP see ICPDR Homepage:  HYPERLINK ""https://www.icpdr.org/main/activities-projects/flood-risk-management"" https://www.icpdr.org/main/activities-projects/flood-risk-managementFor Rhine RBMP see ICPR Homepage: https://www.iksr.org/en/eu-directives/european-water-framework-directive/river-basin-management-planFor Rhine FRMP see ICPR Homepage: https://www.iksr.org/en/eu-directives/floods-directive/flood-risk-management-planFor Elbe RBMP see IKSE Homepage:  HYPERLINK ""http://www.ikse-mkol.org/en/eu-directives/water-framework-directive/international-management-plan-for-the-elbe-river-basin-district/"" http://www.ikse-mkol.org/en/eu-directives/water-framework-directive/international-management-plan-for-the-elbe-river-basin-district/For Elbe FRMP see IKSE Homepage: https://www.ikse-mkol.org/en/eu-directives/flood-risk-management-directive/international-flood-risk-management-plan/","Way forward: Review and revision of national and international plans is foreseen every six years.
