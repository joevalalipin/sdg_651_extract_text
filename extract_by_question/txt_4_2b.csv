"8","4.2b","Status description: In Australia, states and territories are generally responsible for managing water resources in their jurisdiction, including making decision and building, operating and maintaining water infrastructure (e.g. dams, water supply and sewerage treatment systems). The National Water Initiative (NWI) sets out pricing principles for the recovery of capital expenditure, urban water tariffs, recovering the costs of water planning and management activities, recycled water and storm water use. The framework for water pricing in the NWI has been generally deployed and implemented in most states, and the pricing approaches for urban, environmental and rural water users vary. Revenue raised from charges generally cover most IWRM activities although local nuances give rise to quite different outcomes. ","Way forward: ","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

As previously described in 4.1b, WSC was designed to be self-funded through user charges but operates at a loss.
