"7","1.2b","Status description: The whole area of the Republic of Armenia is divided into six Basin Management Areas/Axuryan, Araratyan, Sevan, Hrazdan, Hyusisayin,Haravayin/ . According to Water Code all basin management organisations must have basin management plans that should include water resources offer per different water bodies or water demands per different sectors of economy such as agriculture, hydro energy, industry etc. Besides that, different measures for water resources recovery should be described also there.     Basin Management Plans for three of those (Southern, Ararat and Akhuryan BMA) have been approved by the Government and implemented. However, most of the work has been supported through the donor funded projects, the technical capacity and human resources of the Basin Management Organizations is not sufficient. Work on the development of BMPs for the two of the basins (Sevan and Hrazdan) is expected to finish by 2021 within the regional “EU Water Initiative +” project.","Way forward: According to the Government 5 years period program Armenia  is planning to undertake the development of the last Northern Basin Management Plan by 2023. After that the Republic of Armenia will have fully developed Basin Management tools. The Ministry of Environment is planning to involve main stakeholders, including international donor organizations in the development process.","Armenia_651_2020_EN_Final_24.07.2020.docx"
"8","1.2b","Status description: There are 33 water resource plan areas across the Basin, which include groundwater and surface water areas. Each water resource plan area will have a water resource plan that outlines how a particular area within the Basin will be managed to align with the Basin Plan. Basin states are currently preparing water resource plans within their jurisdictions for assessment and accreditation by the Australian Government.  As at August 2020, thirteen of the required water resource plans have been accredited and are currently operational.The new GAB Plan, developed by Australian state and territory governments, outlines how communities, businesses, traditional owners and governments in the Basin can use the resource sustainably was released in July 2020.  Examples of state and territory planning include: In Western Australia, there are 25 water allocation plans covering priority groundwater and surface water resources at catchment or sub-basin scale. Additional new or replacement groundwater and surface water plans are being developed in response to climate change, new industry initiatives and/or to protect natural systems.  Consultation is underway for a new water allocation plan for the Fitzroy River catchment to support the government position of no dams and sustainable development.  A replacement groundwater allocation plan for the Gnangara groundwater system, the State’s most important groundwater resource, is in preparation, with a policy focus on transitioning water users to adjust to the impacts of climate change.  Depending on the location, water allocation plans may be complemented by water quality improvement plans, water source protection plans, healthy waterways plans, and drainage plans – all at a smaller scale than water allocation plans.In South Australia, water allocation plans have been developed for 31 of the 39 prescribed groundwater, surface water or watercourses that provide the framework for the sustainable take and use of the water resources.  Plans are in development for another five of the prescribed water resources, with the remaining three resources being saltwater intakes that are not currently subject to active management.In the Northern Territory, the Water Act 1992 allows for effective water resource management through the development and implementation of Water Allocation Plans which cover specific regions within designated Water Control Districts. Water Allocation Plans are developed through technical and scientific assessments, and extensive community participation and consultation.","Way forward:Water resource plans will continue to evolve and be adapted over time as new information, including information relating to climate variability, becomes available. They may need to be reaccredited in the future as they are adjusted and improved.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

Review and revision of national plans is foreseen every six years. Austria is a landlocked country. All national parts of the three big international river basin districts Danube (AT1000), Rhine (AT2000) and Elbe (AT5000), and therefore the entire Austrian territory, are covered by the Austrian RBMP. The National RBMP and the National FRMP are in line and coordinated with the international RBMPs and FRMPs for the Danube, the Rhine and the Elbe. Aquifers are enshrined in the agreements and plans.

"11","1.2b","Status description: Because The Bahamas does not have any major surface water bodies, the concept of “basin” plans is not applicable and this response mainly considers groundwater aquifers on individual islands.  There is currently no approved groundwater management plan; however, the nation’s major groundwater reserves are protected indirectly by the Forestry Act.  ","Way forward: The Bahamas continues to conduct detailed groundwater surveys to establish sound management plans to mitigate against identified risks. However, additional stakeholder participation is needed, as The Bahamas is an archipelagic nation. Concerns, while very common, can be specific for each island.

Así mismo, en la última gestión se ha trabajado en una Guía Para la Formulación de Planes de Gestión Sostenible de Acuíferos (Guía PGSA), herramienta que establece el procedimiento para la generación de información requerida para la formulación de los PGSA de acuíferos. Los PGSA, son documentos que se componen de lineamientos específicos sobre cómo debe ser gestionado ese acuífero en particular, es una normativa específica para el manejo de un único acuífero.  Bajo la directriz de dicha guía, actualmente se vienen desarrollando actividades encaminadas a la obtención de los planes de manejo de los acuíferos de Tarija y Sacaba con el apoyo de la Cooperación Internacional del Japón (JICA). Estas acciones en los últimos años han ido mostrando el nivel de importancia, logrando generar Planes de Gestión Sostenible de Acuíferos y las autoridades lo han empezado a utilizar y lo han ido iniciando su ejecución, dado que es un proceso que está en un proceso de implementación se ha optado por darle una ponderación de 50. ","Formas de avanzar: Se cuenta con normativa base para la implementación de acciones en GIRH, sin embargo la Ley del Agua data de 1906, por tanto el desarrollo de una nueva ley podría establecer competencias y responsabilidades más específica tanto del nivel Central como a nivel de las ETA, una alternativa que también  podrá beneficiar las acciones en la temática es la implementación de leyes específicas que cuencas que consideren la planificación y gestión de los acuíferos, dado que hasta la fecha es uno de las áreas más débiles en normativa e investigación.","Bolivia_651_2020_ES_Final_24.09.2020.docx"
