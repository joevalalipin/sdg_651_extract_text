Ces agences ont acquis une expérience avérée en matière de planification des ressources en eau, elles ont conduit les processus d’élaboration des cinq (05) Plans Directeurs d’Aménagement des Ressources en Eau (PDARE) qui ont été examinés au niveau des Comités de Bassins.S’agissant des nappes d’eau souterraines et depuis 2018, une nouvelle approche de leur gestion a été mise en œuvre et ce à travers une démarche participative dans un cadre de concertation et de partenariat, à savoir les « Contrats de nappe et/ou de Captage » qui visent à rassembler l’ensemble des usagers concernés par une nappe afin de la préserver. Cette démarche a abouti aux résultats suivants :Deux (2) contrats de nappe signésCinq (5) contrats de nappe en instance de signatureSept (7) contrats de nappe en cours.Cette approche est appelée à être généralisée.","Perspectives  pour l’avenir : Le processus des contrats de nappes sera poursuivi pour atteindre l’ensemble des aquifères importants selon un planning défini.","Algeria_651_2020_FR_Final_21.10.2020.docx"

"8","2.2a","Status description: The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) was the former peak intergovernmental forum in Australia. COAG was comprised of the Prime Minister, State Premiers, Territory Chief Ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government Association and sought to initiate, develop and monitor the implementation of policy reforms that are of national significance and which require cooperative action by Australian governments. On 29 May 2020, the Prime Minister announced that COAG will cease and a new National Federation Reform Council (NFRC) will be formed, with National Cabinet at the centre of the NFRC. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council) was established by the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement which forms Schedule 1 to the Water Act and comprises of Ministers from each of the Basin states and the Commonwealth who also chairs the Ministerial Council. Ministerial Council’s roles and responsibilities are defined in the Water Act and includes policy and decision-making roles for matters such as state water shares and the funding and delivery of natural resource management programs, as set out in the MDBA. The Ministerial Council is supported by the Basin Officials Committee and various senior officials working groups.The Lake Eyre Basin Ministerial Forum comprises Ministers from each of the Basin states and territory and the Commonwealth who also chairs the forum. The Ministerial Forum will develop or adopt policies and strategies for the management (water and related natural resources) of the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement Area in accordance with the purpose and objectives set out in the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement to avoid or eliminate so far as reasonably practicable adverse cross-border impacts.The MDBA and CEWH were established in 2008 under the Water Act. The MDBA has a lead role in the delivery of Basin reforms including the development and implementation of the Basin Plan. The Basin Plan has various mechanisms which support evaluation and review. The MDBA undertakes an annual review of the effectiveness of the Basin Plan consistent with the Water Act. There are two ‘built-in’ formal evaluations of the Basin Plan. The MDBA conducted a preliminary evaluation in 2017 to monitor progress and shape future management decisions and will conduct five-yearly evaluations of the Basin Plan from 2020.A formal 10-yearly review will take place in 2026, informed by the results of the five-yearly evaluations. In recent years, the MDBA has commenced its compliance program to monitor and enforce compliance with the Basin Plan. The MDBA regulates the state water agencies who have the front-line responsibility for water planning, river operations and water compliance. In undertaking this role, the MDBA has a range of powers and tools available to detect and manage non-compliance, including auditing and investigations (including the use of contemporary technology such as remote sensing). The Independent Assurance Committee (IAC) for Compliance provides expert advice on the design, implementation and adequacy of the MDBA’s Basin Plan compliance program.The CEWH manages water recovered by the Australian Government to protect and restore environmental assets such as rivers, wetlands and floodplains consistent with the Basin Plan Environmental Watering Plan. The MDBA and Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder have capacity and expertise as well as access to practical river operations experience and advanced modelling systems.","Way forward: In 2019 the Water and Environment Research Program was announced. This is a four-year research program worth $20 million to improve scientific knowledge of the Basin to help inform decision and outcomes. The WERP provides an important opportunity to strengthen knowledge and research partnerships, enabling a sound evidence-base for evaluations and to address the complex challenges facing Basin water management. The MDBA is beginning preliminary planning for the review of the Basin Plan in 2026. ","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

While the nation mostly relies on RO for water supply, the first three represent a significant portion of the nation’s limited freshwater reserves; the fourth supports a sizeable population in the nation’s capital through groundwater abstraction from private wells. WSC-WRMU and UNESCO-IHP continue to coordinate water resources concerns with Utility Firms and/or NGOs on Andros (Andros Conservation), Abaco (Friends of the Environment, UNICEF), Grand Bahama (GB Utilities), and New Providence (BNT, BREEF, ReEarth, TNC). However, the responsibilities are spread over numerous organizations with unclear day-to-day directions. The mandate may exist, but efforts taken are not comprehensive enough to provide any benefit to water resource management.","Way forward: Clearly define roles and assign responsibilities with key deliverables.","Bahamas_651_2020_EN_Final_18.11.2020.docx"
