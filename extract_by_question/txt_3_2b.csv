"8","3.2b","Status description: Currently, groundwater is managed under state law. Groundwater management plans vary across jurisdictions and may cover all aquifers or only a portion of aquifers in respective regions. The Australian Government has a leadership role for progressing national water reforms for both surface water and groundwater through the National Water Initiative. To support implementation of the National Water Initiative for groundwater, a National Groundwater Strategic Framework has been prepared.The Australian Government also has legislative roles for both the Basin (under the Water Act and the Basin Plan) and the Lake Eyre Basin (Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement Act 2001) for management of groundwater.The Basin Plan covers three groundwater areas including Eastern Porous Rock, Western Porous Rock and the Goulburn-Murray. A new 15-year Great Artesian Basin Strategic Management Plan (GAB Plan) has been agreed and was released in July 2020. South Australia and Victoria manage shared, cross-border groundwater resources through the Border Groundwater Agreement 2005. ","Way forward: Western Australia prepares new or replacement groundwater allocation plans taking into account community and government objectives, measures to respond to climate change and current and projected information on hydrogeology, rainfall, water use, environmental and cultural considerations and land use changes. State-wide policies and the local policies outlined in water allocation plans are implemented through the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation water licensing process.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"
"9","3.2b","Status description: National River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) is in place and reviewed and revised every six years. The RBMP covers the entire territory and all types of waters, including aquifers. According to the RBMP2009 and the RBMP2015 all 138 groundwaterbodies and groups of groundwaterbodies are in good quantitative status. Stakeholder involvement is organised in the participation process of the RMBP development.","Way forward: Water availability in some regions in future may affected by the effects of climate change. In an Austrian wide study the current and, considering impacts of climate change, the future rate of water abstractions for all Austrian groundwater bodies is evaluated. The process for Draft RBMP 2021 is on track.","Austria_651_2020_EN_Final_13.08.2020.docx"

Fortunately, the primary groundwater resource areas on Abaco, Andros, and Grand Bahama are within the protected Forestry Reserve Areas for the Nation. Water & Sewerage Cooperation (WSC) monitors water quality, water availability, and abstraction rates for the primary water reserve areas. ","Way forward: Under the newly established DEPP, one organization will be responsible for water, climate and biodiversity, providing opportunity for a more comprehensive approach to aquifer management.","Bahamas_651_2020_EN_Final_18.11.2020.docx"
