"3","2.2b","État d’avancement :L’Article 15 de la constitution de 2016 stipule que « l’Etat encourage la démocratie participative au niveau des collectivités locales ».Les comités de bassins hydrographiques regroupent en leur sein des représentants de la société civile. Ces derniers contribuent à l’examen des dossiers relatifs à la planification des ressources en eau. Dans le cadre de la promotion et de la mise en œuvre d’une nouvelle politique de proximité, le Ministère de l’Intérieur et des collectivités locales a favorisé et développé au niveau local une nouvelle approche de participation basée sur :L’intégration de l’approche participative dans les programmes de développement local ;La finalisation d’une opération pilote d’intégration de l’approche participative dans l’élaboration d’audits socio-économiques au niveau de 250 communes ;La formation au niveau local de diplômés à l’approche participative.Dans le cadre des grandes réformes institutionnelles menées par l’Algérie ces dernières années, et plus particulièrement, l’introduction dans la Constitution de 2016 de la démocratie participative au niveau des collectivités territoriales, le Gouvernement algérien a initié un projet de coopération avec l’Union Européenne et le Programme des Nations Unies pour le Développement (PNUD), qui vise à promouvoir l’implication des citoyens et de la société civile dans la gestion communale et le développement local durable et intégré. Porté par le Ministère de l’Intérieur, des Collectivités Locales et de l’Aménagement du Territoire.

"8","2.2b","Status description: The Water Act and the Basin Plan set out the consultation requirements for the development of state Water Resource Plans (WRPs), the environmental watering plan and annual environmental watering priorities. These include specific requirements for consultation on Indigenous values and uses of water resources. Sub-national governments conduct public consultation and engagement in various ways, such as:Western Australia’s Department of Water undertook extensive public consultation in 2012 on proposed changes to State water legislation outlined in the publication of Securing Western Australia’s water future – a position paper. The public was invited to submit written responses to the position paper. The department also conducted workshops in metropolitan and regional areas with water licensees and interested stakeholders. A Water Resources Management Bill is being drafted to incorporate government policies and address issues identified during the consultation phase of the proposed new legislation. Public participation is part of all local water planning processes.The Australian Capital Territory undertook community consultation on its draft water resource plan in 2016.Queensland announced the public consultation process on its draft environmental values and water quality objectives via gazette notice in 2017 and subsequent public notices in local newspapers. Consultations drafts were available for comment online via a survey for each project region. Queensland’s Warrego-Paroo-Nebine Water Resource Plan was recently accredited and it demonstrated extensive consultation with the local community, including the Indigenous community, during the preparation of the WRP.  New South Wales has undertaken extensive public consultation in its water resource plan development process, including inviting key stakeholders to make submissions on initial discussion papers on the issues in each catchment, conducting targeted and on-going engagement with locally-based stakeholders through established Stakeholder Advisory Panels and Environmental Water Advisory Groups in each catchment, extensive consultation with First Nations groups, and public exhibition of draft statutory instruments.Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory also undertook similar consultation and engagement processes as part of the development of their water resource plans.Victoria has placed formal obligations on catchment management authorities and water corporations requiring extensive public consultation when undertaking water resources, policy, planning and management at the local level. This includes requiring engagement with traditional owners. In South Australia, the regional natural resources management boards (soon to be replaced by landscape boards under the Landscape South Australia Act 2019) have a community-based membership. The boards are responsible for undertaking community consultation during the development or amendment of water allocation plans for the prescribed water resources in their region. Since 2018, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has employed a number of Regional Engagement Officers located in Basin communities. This growing regional network regularly engage with local stakeholders to improve the flow of two-way communication between communities and the MDBA. Basin Community Committee (BCC) provides a community perspective on a wide range of water resource, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic matters. They report on community concerns and issues around Basin Plan implementation and provide information to Basin communities on different programs. To assist in its advisory role the BCC forms irrigation, environmental water and Indigenous water subcommittees. CEWO recently employed an additional six local engagement officers that live within local communities throughout the Basin and who consult extensively with stakeholders regarding delivery of the Commonwealth environmental water portfolio.The Lake Eyre Basin Community Advisory Committee and the Scientific Advisory Panel who provide community views and expert science advice to Ministers on matters affecting the health of the Basin.","Way forward: The Australian Government is relocating one third of MDBA staff to regional offices in the Basin by 2021. Further regionalising the MDBA creates opportunities to strengthen understanding of the Basin and its stakeholders, improve stakeholder relationships, and enhance its regional water management connections. There may also be opportunities for the MDBA to facilitate improved information flow and coordination of Australian Government initiatives at the local level.Recent MDBA initiatives such as the development of a Native Fish Recovery Strategy have a strong focus on local engagement to build enduring partnerships with communities to design and implement on-ground actions.
