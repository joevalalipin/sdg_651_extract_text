As the main entity for the management of water resources, the Antigua Public Utilities Authority, a statutory body acquires revenue through the provision of services such as Electricity and Water to offset the expenses of the organisation. However, there are major gaps in finances mainly in terms of operational costs thus, the government of Antigua and Barbuda plays a supplementary role in the provision of additional resources. ","Way forward: Sources of funding should be identified to support the allocated budgets.","Antigua and Barbuda_651_2020_EN_Final_31.08.2020.docx"

"8","4.1a","Status description:Australia is viewed as a world leader in water management with water reform achievements a direct result of the co-operation between Australian Federal, State and Territory Governments. The Australian Government has been co-investing with state governments to accelerate the construction of major water infrastructure projects such as dams, weirs, pipelines, managed aquifer recharge, and waste water treatment and reuse schemes to provide affordable and secure water supplies to support the growth of regional economies and communities across Australia.Since 2007, the Australian Government has committed more than $15 billion for water reform activities. Of this, $8 billion funds a range of activities aimed at increasing water use efficiency in the Murray-Darling Basin (the Basin). For example, more than 2700 on-farm projects across the Basin are demonstrating real water efficiency gains and helping farmers modernise and improve their on-farm infrastructure. More than 12,000 irrigators are benefitting from improvements to water delivery systems, with the modernisation of more than 2,500 kilometres of delivery network channels. The construction of 14 sustainable irrigation schemes across Tasmania has increased the potential irrigable area to over 200,000 hectares. This commitment is in addition to the $1.5 billion National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF) and a $2 billion National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility which are available to state and territory governments to provide funding to support the identification and construction of new water infrastructure.Through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (NWIDF) and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility (NWILF), the Australian Government has committed $1.53 billion to co-fund the construction of 22 water infrastructure projects with a total construction value of more than $2.74 billion. This is in addition to $132.99 million committed to 52 feasibility studies, including $96.46 million for 23 studies in Northern Australia. These studies will identify opportunities to develop new water infrastructure that will deliver new and affordable water, be economically viable and environmentally sustainable and enhance the productivity and profitability of regional economies.Recently an additional $34.9 million of Australian Government funding has been made available for the Great Artesian Basin (building on the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative), and $50 million for the On-Farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme program.","Way forward:Social and economic assessments of the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 (the Basin Plan) have been (and are being) undertaken, with funding provided for programs to support communities with structural adjustment, such as the Murray-Darling Basin Economic Development Program ($40 million for Rounds 1 and 2). There is also a strong focus on the provision of funding for strengthening water compliance, including drafting of new statutory arrangements at the Commonwealth level. The Australian Government is also working with the state and territory governments to develop a national framework for investing in water infrastructure, supported by scientific research that provides the evidence base to underpin investment decisions.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

Some money is built into the national annual budget for subsidies to WSC and to the Ministry of Public Works for infrastructure operation and maintenance. Since The Bahamas relies less on its natural freshwater reserves for water supply, ‘soft’ infrastructure and environmental measures to protect the ecological value of these reserves are key areas for future funding.  Environmental planning is a function of the DEPP, which, to date, has mostly received funds to begin operation.","Way forward: Increase investment in ‘soft’ infrastructure and environmental measures.
