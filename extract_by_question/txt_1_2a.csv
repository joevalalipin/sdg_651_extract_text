However, there are marz development plans that usually have a small section on environment/water, where they mention specific projects envisioned for implementation locally, such as repairing irrigation network section, implementation of relevant donor funded or other activities within the marz. Thus, water resources management in the Republic of Armenia is carried out taking into consideration basin management principal. Armenian Government has adopted 3 basin management plans for BMOs. 2 basin management plans are being under development process now. The basin management plans include program of measures to improve status of water bodies. These measure include construction of agglomeration, development of legislative and institutional system etc.","Way forward:","Armenia_651_2020_EN_Final_24.07.2020.docx"

Also, since fresh water is an increasingly scarce resource, it is recommended to encourage installation of rainwater catchment systems not only in Family Islands, but in the capital as well. Rainwater systems can reduce dependence on well water in some locations. Contamination of aquifers threaten the quality of well water.","Bahamas_651_2020_EN_Final_18.11.2020.docx"
