"8","3.2c","Status description: Various Commonwealth and State agencies collect and share water information as well as making the data publicly available. For example:The Water Act gives the BoM water information data collecting and information sharing functions that are in addition to its existing functions under the Meteorology Act 1955, including:collecting, holding, managing, interpreting and disseminating Australia’s water information;providing regular reports on the status of Australia’s water resources and patterns of usage of those resources;providing regular forecasts on the future availability of Australia’s water resources;compiling and maintaining water accounts for Australia, including a set of water accounts to be known as the National Water Accounts; issuing National Water Information Standards; BoM publishes water data received from Australian organisations under the Water Act through data portals (e.g. water data online, groundwater explorer) and a range of online products and dashboards which share information on water markets, water storages, water restrictions, urban water indicators and climate resilient water sources. New South Wales provides real time data for river water levels and flows, dam storage elevations and volumes, groundwater and meteorology. The NSW Water Insight publishes dashboards with information about water allocations, trades and water resource availability outlooks for regulated and unregulated water sources.South Australia makes real time water data available for surface water levels and flows, storage volumes and levels and groundwater levels.  South Australia publishes information on water allocation trade price and volume, and allocation trades, updated daily via water trade dashboards. South Australia also provides a range of water related information on the WaterConnect website including status reports for groundwater and surface water resources, water trade information for prescribed water resources and aquatic ecosystem condition reports. Tasmania’s Water Information System and web portals allow searches for data relating to water flow, water quality, and groundwater, freshwater ecosystem values and water entitlement and dam permits.Northern Territory’s Water Data and Water Licensing portals deliver data specific to activities such flood monitoring, water allocation planning and aquatic health monitoring including real time data on groundwater levels, surface water levels/discharge and both groundwater and surface water licence registers.Victoria’s Water Measurement Information System provides data and information on river and wetland health monitoring, groundwater monitoring and community water monitoring, and links to water storage and allocation information from water utilities. Victoria also publishes summary information about water market trading within regulated systems.Western Australia’s Water Information Reporting portal and river level monitoring website provides surface water, groundwater and rainfall data and other information to developers, researchers and the broader community. An online water register gives the location of water licences to support trading.Western Australia publishes a spatial data download tool to promote better water management, as well as up-to-date data for surface water level and flow, groundwater levels, water quality and rainfall through the Water Information Reporting tool.Queensland’s Water Monitoring Information Portal has information regarding latest and historical stream height and stream flows, rainfall data and groundwater levels data. The Queensland Globe, an online interactive tool, turns physical, geographical and spatial data about a particular location into map format.The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) provides water data to BoM, for publication via BoM’s water information products and services. The ACT continues to implement its Water Strategy, which focuses on managing the Territory's water resources to meet urban, environmental and regional objectives. The Australian Government’s Bioregional Assessment Programme provides transparent scientific information to decisions makers about the potential cumulative impacts of coal seam gas and coal mining development on water resources and water dependent assets such as wetlands and groundwater bores.The MDBA and sub-national governments and agencies hold information on storage volumes, river flows (including models), and water use accounts for the systems they are responsible for. The MDBA also relies on the BoM’s Australia-wide historic water dataset to inform its planning and operations.  There are reporting requirements in the Basin Plan for all departments and agencies to ensure information to evaluate the Basin Plan is provided to the MDBA for this purpose.Geoscience Australia also collects groundwater-related data and information as part of the science and research programs it undertakes across Australia, the most recent being the Exploring for the Future Program. The data, information and analysis from these activities is made publicly available for use by governments, industry, communities and other interested stakeholders.","Way forward: Work is ongoing to maintain the relevance, currency, functionality and rigour of Australia’s water information systems.Management of data across Basin jurisdictions and between federal government agencies is highly variable, and technology, format and frequency of measurement differ across different agencies. The standardisation of data management systems would help to improve data sharing arrangements and enable an adaptable and enduring Basin scale view informed by consistent and compatible water information. A number of initiatives to improve data sharing between government agencies are currently underway. The BoM continues to host biannual water information reference group meetings with state and territory government water authorities to discuss strategies to coordinate and improve the flow of water information.  A new non-urban water metering framework in New South Wales will increase the amount and availability of real-time water use information from telemetered water meters in that state. Other major initiatives in the Basin are proposed to increase transparency of near real time water availability, water use and compliance information through whole-of-basin water portals.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

En outre, il est acquis du matériel de dernière génération pour le suivi des ressources en eau, notamment le ProSyscal et un package de géophysique. A tout cela s’ajoute l’équipement destiné au laboratoire pour le suivi de la qualité et le matériel destiné aux suivis hydrométrique et piézométrique. ","Perspectives pour l’avenir : Former davantage d’agents au maniement des équipements acquis. Produire régulièrement des anales hydrologiques et hydrogéologiques et les rapports annuels sur l’état des ressources en eau. Renforcer la Base de Données et assurer sa mise à jour régulière. Faire le plaidoyer pour qu’un budget substantiel soit affecté aux activités de suivi des ressources. ","Benin_651_2020_FR_Final_29.09.2020.docx"
