"8","2.1c","Status description: The Water Act sets out a legislated consultation process, which the MDBA is required to follow, for the preparation of amendments to the Basin Plan. Public consultation has also occurred during previous reviews, such as the 2014 Water Act Review, the ACCC review into the water charge rules and BoM’s water information review. Reviews such as these regularly allow members of the public to make a submission as part of the review process. The ACCC also provided multiple opportunities between 2015 and 2016 for stakeholders to participate as part of the review of the water charge rules prior to finalising its advice to the Minister for consideration. These reviews and other inquiries undertaken by Australia’s Parliamentary Committees provide opportunities for stakeholders to participate and provide contributions for consideration. The Water Act also requires the PC to undertake a five-yearly assessment of the effectiveness of implementation of the Basin Plan and Water Resource Plans and a triennial assessment of progress of parties to the National Water Initiative (NWI). A legislated consultation process must be followed for the Basin Plan assessments and assessments of NWI progress require, by legislation, the establishment of a stakeholder working group. Efficiency Measures programs are developed in consultation with business, government, industry and community stakeholders. In mid-2015, the then Department of Agriculture and Water Resources sought advice from key stakeholders in the development of a draft program design for the first of these programs the Commonwealth On-Farm Further Irrigation Efficiency (COFFIE) program, and in late 2015 the department sought comments about the draft program design through a broad public consultation process. The Water Efficiency Program was established to address additional socio-economic criteria agreed by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council. These criteria were established in response to feedback from the community in relation to potential adverse socio-economic impacts associated with the delivery of Efficiency Measures programs. The Water Efficiency Program also includes a public comment process for each proposed water savings project. Water programs are subject to a high level of internal and external scrutiny through audits conducted by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), internal audits, parliamentary and other inquiries and reviews. Currently an independent review of the Efficiency Measures programs funded under the Water for the Environment Special Account is being undertaken to determine the progress made towards achieving the outcomes as required by the Water Act.The Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) employs six local engagement officers that live within local communities throughout the Basin and who consult extensively with stakeholders regarding delivery of the Commonwealth environmental water portfolio. Each year the CEWO provides opportunities for local communities to take part in the planning and management of the Commonwealth environmental water portfolio through input into the development of annual Portfolio management plans. Formal representative groups include:Northern Basin Advisory Committee and Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations, which participated in the recent Northern Basin Review.Lake Eyre Basin Community Advisory Committee and Lake Eyre Basin Scientific Advisory Panel, which maintain close contact with communities and groups in the basin and provide advice, representation and feedback on matters relevant to the management of water and related natural resources in the Lake Eyre Basin Agreement area.Murray-Darling Basin Community Committee provides a community perspective on a wide range of water resource, environment, culture and socioeconomic matters in relation to Basin Plan implementation GABCC provides advice from community organisations and agencies to Ministers on efficient, effective and sustainable whole-of-resource management, and coordinates activity between stakeholders. The GABCC will be replaced by GABSAC in late 2020.During the development phase of the Basin Plan the MDBA consulted widely to draw on people’s knowledge, experience and expertise.The MDBA invited people to make submissions on the proposed Basin Plan. The invitation was published in metropolitan and regional newspapers in the Basin, on the MDBA's website, and in a Special Gazette.During this time the MDBA also organised a wide range of meetings and events to engage with many different stakeholder groups in the Basin.Engagement with Aboriginal people has occurred over the past couple of decades through the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations and in the last ten years, with the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations. Engagement with traditional owners is increasing with involvement in capacity-building projects such as cultural flows research and their participation in formal consultative process for the proposed Basin Plan. Local traditional owners have been consulted by state agencies in the development of catchment-based water resource plans that sit under the Basin Plan.Community and private sector engagement is an essential part of processes for state water resource management planning, as outlined in the NWI Policy Guidelines for Water Planning and Management: https://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/policy/nwi/guidelines-water.The Western Australian Government released the Waterwise Perth Action Plan which sets out the direction for transitioning Perth to a waterwise city by 2030.  The plan includes numerous actions to be implemented by state agencies, industry, business and the community to deliver water use efficiencies and the development of alternative water supplies to ensure Perth’s lifestyle and business opportunities are maintained in a changing climate.","Way forward: An Independent Murray-Darling Basin Social and Economic Assessment Panel (the Panel) was recently established to deliver a report on the social and economic conditions in the Basin. The Panel sought public feedback on its Terms of Reference during late July and August 2019 and undertook a substantial community engagement roadshow during October 2019. The final report was submitted 30 of April 2020.The Panel sought public feedback on its Terms of Reference during late July and August 2019 and undertook a substantial community engagement roadshow during October 2019.The Interim Inspector-General of Murray–Darling Basin Water Resources, Mick Keelty AO, has undertaken an Inquiry into the management of the Basin’s water resources. The Interim Inspector-General has consulted with stakeholders across the Basin to inform aspects of the Inquiry.This Inquiry was conducted independent to DAWE. The Inquiry was completed with a report provided to the Minister on 31 March 2020.On 7 August 2019 the Government directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into the operation of water markets in the Basin. The ACCC will be asked to recommend options to enhance transparency, regulation, competitiveness and efficiency of the water markets.The ACCC has consulted with a wide range of water market participants and other persons involved in water markets in the Basin.The ACCC is required to complete the inquiry and provide a final report to the Treasurer by 30 November 2020. The Australian Government continues to work in partnership with jurisdictions to implement the current NWI and progress reform priorities identified through the PC’s first inquiry into water reform in 2017.  The PC will undertake its second triennial assessment in 2020 and this will help inform future reform efforts. ","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"
