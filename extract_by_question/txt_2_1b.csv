"8","2.1b","Status description: Currently there are several working groups and committees where government authorities representing different sectors participate in water resources policy, planning and management. For example, the Murray-Darling Basin Community Committee (established under the Water Act) represents the diverse interests of Basin communities including water users, industry groups and First Nation Representatives. The Murray-Darling Basin Officials Committee (also established under the Water Act) facilitates cooperation and coordination between the federal government, the Basin states and MDBA in funding works, managing the Basin water resources and implementing the Basin Plan. The Murray Darling Basin Ministerial Council (the Council) comprises Water Ministers from each of the Basin states and the Commonwealth, with the Federal Minister chairing the council. The Council has policy and decision-making roles for matters such as state water shares, and the funding and delivery of natural resource management programs, as set out in the Murray–Darling Basin Agreement. MDBA is required to prepare an annual corporate plan for approval by the Ministerial Council in relation to these matters. The Council also has a policy and decision-making role regarding issues relating to critical human needs as provided for in the Water Act.The Australian Government along with the States and Territory Governments meet to discuss national water reform matters and developments through the National Water Reform Committee (NWRC) and its sub committees including the Urban Water Reform Committee (UWRC).Interim NWRC and sub-committee arrangements were established in 2014 to continue cooperative national water reforms across all jurisdictions. Jurisdictional Water Ministers agreed to the formalisation of the NWRC in March 2017. Sub-committees are tasked with delivering priority reform projects e.g. developing a National Groundwater Strategic Framework.Established in 2004, the Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee (GABCC) provides advice from community organisations and agencies to Ministers on efficient, effective and sustainable whole-of-resource management, and coordinates activity between stakeholders. The GABCC will disband on the release of the Great Artesian Basin Strategic Management Plan (GAB Plan). The Great Artesian Basin Stakeholder Advisory Committee (GABSAC) will be established in its place.The Lake Eyre Basin Community Advisory and the Lake Eyre Basin Scientific Advisory Panel provide community views and expert science advice to Ministers on matters affecting the health of the basin. The National Performance Roundtable group report on water utilities and the inter-jurisdictional Water Efficiency Standards and Labelling Group.There is also the Independent Expert Scientific Committee that provides advice for coal seam gas and large coal mining projects which required a federal environmental assessment, including assessments of significant impacts on water resources.Geoscience Australia is working with national government departments and authorities (for example DAWE, the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, the NWGA and BoM) on a range of groundwater-related projects that facilitate coordination between government agencies on water resource understanding, planning and management. Geoscience Australia also provides groundwater-related advice to regulatory authorities that are involved in the planning and management of water resources and participates in a number of the national water resource coordination activities and meetings discussed in this document.Geoscience Australia in collaboration with State/Northern Territory government agencies, research and industry partners is finalising the Exploring for the Future Programme, which is a four-year geoscience data and information collection programme that aims to better understand the groundwater resource potential of Northern Australia. The groundwater programme focuses on addressing groundwater resource knowledge gaps to underpin future opportunities for irrigated agriculture, mineral and energy development and community water supply.","Way forward: The Australian Government appointed an independent panel to assess social and economic conditions in rural and regional communities across the Basin and identify the social and economic impacts of the water reforms on Basin communities and their development potential. The Panel delivered their findings in early 2020 and the Government is currently considering options to respond to the recommendations made in relation to drivers and impacts in other sectors. The GABSAC is being established to enable Basin ministers, responsible for Great Artesian Basin matters to be fully advised of the views of industry, communities and other stakeholders on water matters concerning the Great Artesian Basin. The Committee is to work together with Great Artesian Basin governments to provide advice to support ministers’ decision making on whole-of-Basin matters. Members of the Committee will have skills-based expertise in relevant fields including groundwater science, economic development, environmental matters, water resource policy, social matters and community education and engagement.The Australian Government directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into markets for tradeable water rights in the Basin. The ACCC will be asked to recommend options to enhance markets for tradeable water rights, including options to enhance their operations, transparency, regulation, competitiveness and efficiency.","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

"11","2.1b","Status description: There is some history of cross-sector consultation on water resources policy, planning and management; for example, stakeholders from over 11 government ministries and agencies were consulted during the formulation of the 2007 IWRM plan. More recently, PAHO conducted a multi-stakeholder workshop on the health, water and sanitation components of the Over-the-Hill (OTH) Community Development Partnership Initiative. The Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of the Environment & Housing, Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) and stakeholders from other sectors were involved in this workshop. Collaboration between the WSC and OTH Initiative continued after the workshop to mobilize environment wardens to advocate for water conservation, and improvement of waste disposal to avoid contamination of groundwater. Mechanisms for coordination exist, but are utilised infrequently (e.g. in extreme conditions). ","Way forward: Progressive collective action on IWRM implementation requires regular cross-sector engagement and communication. A standardized template of policy design, coordination and implementation can be used to ensure cross-sector coordination.","Bahamas_651_2020_EN_Final_18.11.2020.docx"
