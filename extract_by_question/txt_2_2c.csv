"8","2.2c","Status description: The National Water Initiative recognises the water needs of Indigenous Australians by the necessity to consider these needs in water access planning and management. These involve:the inclusion of Indigenous representation in water planning;developing water plans that incorporate Indigenous social, spiritual and customary objectives, and strategies for achieving these objectives; water planning processes that consider the possible existence of native title rights to water and the allocation of water to native title holders; andaccounting for water allocated to native title holders for traditional cultural purposes.Indigenous involvement has been improving over the past couple of decades with increased representation and, more recently, commitments to provide legal access to water for cultural and social purposes. More recently, engagement with Aboriginal nations was undertaken during the development of WRP’s under the Basin Plan.In the 2017 review of National Water Reform, the PC made several recommendations regarding the need to revisit the NWI revising policy settings to address the needs of Indigenous Australians. The PC found that some states and territories had progressed consultation with Indigenous communities in water planning processes, but this did not extend to explicitly including details of Indigenous cultural values and outcomes in water plans. The final report found all jurisdictions needed to undertake further work in this area. While some jurisdictions have made provisions for Indigenous access to water for economic use and development purposes, the NWI does not explicitly address the need to provide Indigenous Australians water for economic development purposes. Indigenous communities may source water entitlements for consumptive use through standard entitlement frameworks; however, without removal of historical barriers, access remains a key area that needs to be addressed by government policy. In 1998, the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations (MLDRIN) confederation was established to pursue Aboriginal interests in water resource management in the southern half of the Murray-Darling Basin. The Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations confederation was formed in 2010 to represent Aboriginal nations in the northern part of the Murray-Darling Basin. The Water Act provides for BCC’s to provide a community perspective on water resource, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic matters. The BCC includes two dedicated Aboriginal committee members and an Indigenous subcommittee, who provide advice on matters relating to Aboriginal interests in the Basin.The Water Act was amended in September 2019 to provide for the appointment of an Indigenous Authority member on the board of the MDBA. The Australian Government has taken action to improve water access for Aboriginal people in the Basin by establishing the Murray-Darling Basin Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program. This program will provide $40 million over 4 years to help Indigenous communities invest in water for cultural and economic activities. The Australian Government has also funded research to inform our understanding of Aboriginal values relating to water. The National Cultural Flows Research Project is also developing tools to better integrate Aboriginal water requirements and preferences into water policy making and decisions. ","Way forward: Governments have, on a no regrets basis, committed to explore renewing the way in which Indigenous water interests and uses are reflected in the NWI. The PC are currently undertaking the next review of the NWI and it will consider how jurisdictions have improved Indigenous involvement in water planning, the achievement of cultural outcomes, and progress made towards providing water for economic purposes.  The Birrarung Council was appointed by the Government in August 2018 as prescribed by the Yarra River Protection (Wilip-gin Birrarung murron) Act 2017 (the Act) to be the independent voice of the Yarra River as a living entity and to provide independent advice to the Government on the implementation of the Act.Traditional Owners have a permanent voice through the Act’s requirement that at least two members of the Birrarung Council must be nominated from the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation. The Birrarung Council will champion the interests of the Yarra River as one living and integrated natural entity, as reflected in the 50-year Community Vision and the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people’s place based water policy response to the Act; (Nhanbu narrun ba ngargunin twarn Birrarung)","Australia_651_2020_EN_Final_12.08.2020.docx"

There is no specific provision for the participation of vulnerable groups as it relates to availability of water or participation in IWRM. Over 99% of Barbadian home have water in their homes and a series of public stand pipes are across the island. Presently there is no structured mechanism, outside of Town Hall Meetings for the public to participate in the management of Water Resources as a stakeholder. This makes it hard to score this question other than Not Applicable.
